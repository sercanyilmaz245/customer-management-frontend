## 📌 Notes

- No multi-user support — this app is meant for **a single panel user only**.
- For production use, consider securing API routes and storing user credentials safely (e.g., using JWT, sessions, or OAuth).
- Backend logic should handle secure password hashing, authentication, and customer data persistence.
